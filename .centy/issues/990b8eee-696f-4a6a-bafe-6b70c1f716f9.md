# Pre-commit hook: spell check with cspell

## Overview

Add a pre-commit hook that runs `cspell` to catch spelling errors before committing.

## Implementation

Create `.husky/pre-commit` (or extend it) with:

```sh
npx cspell "**/*.{rs,md,toml,json}" --no-progress
```

## Config

- Config is already in `cspell.json` at the project root
- Known words (`cdylib`, `dylint`, `rustc`) are already whitelisted
- Extend the words list in `cspell.json` as needed

## Acceptance Criteria

- Hook blocks commit when unknown words are found
- Hook passes when all words are known or whitelisted

# Pre-push hook: run tests with cargo test

## Overview

Add a pre-push hook that runs the full test suite before pushing.

## Implementation

Add to `.husky/pre-push`:

```sh
cargo test
```

## Notes

- Dylint lint tests use `dylint_testing` (see `[dev-dependencies]` in `Cargo.toml`)
- Tests are integration-style: they compile example code in `examples/` and check lint output
- Tests can take a while due to compilation; placing this in pre-push (not pre-commit) keeps commits fast
- Uses the pinned nightly toolchain from `rust-toolchain.toml`

## Acceptance Criteria

- Hook blocks push when any test fails
- Hook passes when all tests pass

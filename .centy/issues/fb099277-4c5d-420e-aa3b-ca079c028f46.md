# Pre-push hook: build check with cargo build

## Overview

Add a pre-push hook that verifies the project builds successfully before pushing.

## Implementation

Create `.husky/pre-push` with:

```sh
cargo build
```

## Notes

- Catches compilation errors that would break CI
- Uses the pinned nightly toolchain from `rust-toolchain.toml`
- The crate is a `cdylib` so this verifies the shared library compiles cleanly
- Run before push (not commit) because it can be slow

## Acceptance Criteria

- Hook blocks push when the project fails to compile
- Hook passes on a successful build

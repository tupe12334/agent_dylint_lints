# Setup Husky git hooks

## Overview

Install and configure [Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/) to manage git hooks for the project.

## Tasks

- Install Husky via npm/pnpm (add `package.json` to the project)
- Run `husky init` to scaffold the `.husky/` directory
- Add `prepare` script to `package.json` so Husky installs on `npm install`

## Notes

- This is a Rust project, so Husky is used purely for git lifecycle scripting
- All hook scripts should be executable (`chmod +x`)
- Hook scripts should exit with non-zero on failure to block the git operation
